A real callout, for contrast:

:::callout{type=info title="Real"}
This one renders.
:::

Directive-like text inside a fenced code block must stay literal text, not
be parsed as a directive:

```
:::callout{type=warning title="Not real"}
This should NOT render as a callout — it's inside a code fence.
:::

:kbd[Ctrl+S] should also stay literal here.
```

And inline code should protect directive-like text too: `:kbd[literal]`.
